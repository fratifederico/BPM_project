## Introduction:
Welcome to the presentation of our business project on generative AI for user guide generation. In this project, we explored the potential of using generative AI to automatically generate comprehensive and informative user guides from product specifications. Our main objective was to investigate the capabilities and limitations of generative AI in handling complex specifications and streamlining the user guide creation process.

## Objective:
Our project aimed to answer the fundamental question: Can generative AI be harnessed to generate high-quality user guides solely based on product specifications? We wanted to understand the level of complexity that can be effectively handled by the AI model and explore its practical applications in documentation processes.

## Methodology:
To achieve our objective, we employed the generative AI model GPT 3.5 Turbo. We designed several Python scripts to study the behavior of generative AI in developing user guides. These scripts utilized data preprocessing techniques to prepare the product specifications for input into the AI model.

## Validation Metrics:
Throughout the project, we employed various validation metrics to assess the quality and accuracy of the generated user guides. These metrics allowed us to evaluate the performance of our generative AI-based solution. These included:
  
  *-Self-assessment*  
  *-Length analysis*  
  *-Cosine similarity*  
  *-Human evaluation*  
  *-Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)*
